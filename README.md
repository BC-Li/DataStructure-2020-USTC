## How can I make use of this repository?
Take the codes in this repo as a reference for your study, but be careful cause the codes are not always right.

Kindly note that you shouldn't just copy the codes and hand them in as your homework. This **can not** do any good to your study career if you are not familiar with your basic knowledge. 

Plus, you might be caught by your TAs and **lose** your scores for a specific lab work.
